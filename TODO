Lxc::control:
 * Write makefile
 * Make normal tests
 * Determine if and how we can make test to create container.
 * Die on all errors, lxctl should use exceptions to handle this situation.
 * Stop physically deleted but running container.
 * GHOST state detection.
 
lxctl:
 * GHOST state detection.
 * GHOST state fix ability.
 * Check if container is running before destroying.
 * Workaround LVB bug with LV names (eg. if LV test exists, creating of test1 will fail) - bug is not working!
 * Check IP correctness.
 * IP-based MAC-address generation.
