Fix before 0.1:
+* Installation should create some folders (/etc/lxc, /var/lxc)
 * Some systems may have default config not in /var/lib/lxc
+* We should depend on at least lxc-0.7.4
 * Fix lucid_amd64.tar.gz not to remount / to ro on shutdown
 * Check config host's network config for br0 (port from autovm's preinst?)

Fix somewhere before public release:
 * Lxc.pm does not always detect errors. (maybe won't fix, becouse when daemonizing container, all output is surpassed, as work-around we can try to eval status and start container not in daemon mode to get normal output from it.)
 * Distros other than ubuntu may have different default location for lxc's config (e.x. Gentoo). Handle this properly.
